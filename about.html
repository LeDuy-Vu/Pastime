        <p> Our goal is to develop a convenient web app for citizens for the city to find recreational activities for you, your friends, and your families. It has the ability to filter by searching any tags. The web app allows users to buy points for the
            activity they are interested in. These points are stored in an electronic card. These cards are used to “pay” for a set activity price. The set activity price is specified by the activity organizer (known as the service provider). Admins have
            accounts and complete control over all activities, but activity providers can only edit their created activity.
