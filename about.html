        <p> Our goal is to develop a convenient web app for citizens for the city to find recreational activities for you, your friends, and your families. It will have the ability to filter by age- category (preschool, 10-12, adults, seniors, etc.), and proximity (5 miles, 10 miles, 15 miles, etc.). Cost, dates, and times are additional filters that it is available with. The web app will allow users to buy points for the activity they are interested in. These points are stored in an electronic card.

        These cards are used to “pay” for a set activity price. The set activity price is specified by the activity organizer (known as the service provider). Admins have accounts and complete control over all activities, but activity providers can only edit their created activity.
